# Snail Mail

I love writing and receiving letters. Part of the satisfaction from the the tangible quality of communication - I can touch it, I can see how time and travel has weathered it, just a bit. 

But I think part of the joy of sending letters is the asynchronous nature of sending/receiving them. There's an element of surprise - you may know it's on the way, but you're not usually able to predict exactly when it will arrive (especially these days). 

I'm particularly interested in speculative design, imagining the what-ifs and what could-bes around technology. Communication seems an area ripe for speculative design, as our methods of communications have drastically changed within the last century. But for better or worse, the emphasis on changing communications has been speed. But now that we have near instantaneous communication across the globe, it seems like perhaps having constant, rapid communication all the time isn't what we want. 

I have friends who work in technology (engineering/etc) as well as those who do not, who both feel the constant communication on email, text message, slack, facebook message, instagram direct messages, facetime, zoom, skype, etc. is constantly taking their attention away from other things. 

So why not use and subvert technology by creating a slower communication app? Similar to a direct message platform, users can find other users, write a message and then send it over. But unlike traditional direct messages platforms, the message will not be sent immediately, but rather in a timeframe more akin to that of sending physical mail. 

Is this useful? Probably not, at least in a practical sense. But I do see the value in reimagining how communication can exist - particularly questioning the preconceptions we have around digital communication.
